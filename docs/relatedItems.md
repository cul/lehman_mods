There should be 3 related items for Lehman:

1.  The Project (title comes  from CLIO)

<relatedItem type="host" displayLabel="Project">
<titleInfo>
<title>Lehman Special Correspondence Files</title>
</titleInfo>
<location>
<url>http://www.columbia.edu/cgi-bin/cul/resolve?clio6606869</url>
</location>
</relatedItem>

2. The Collection (title comes from the Archival Collections portal)

<relatedItem type="host" displayLabel="Collection">
<titleInfo>
<title>Herbert H. Lehman Papers</title>
</titleInfo>
</relatedItem>

3.  The file folder (unit that houses a particular item)
This addresses your example below.  I don't think we need a display label here as long as we make the relationship clear in the title. I would add the word "file" after "Correspondence" in the square brackets and remove the name of the collection/project which will be included in the elements 1 and 2 above. For example:

<mods:relatedItem type="host">
<mods:titleInfo>
<mods:title>Magnuson, Warren G. [Correspondence file].</mods:title>
</mods:titleInfo>
